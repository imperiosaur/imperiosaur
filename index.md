Welcome to OP Chronicles! This is a site dedicated to helping GMs prepare scenarios for different organized play campaigns. In this site, you will find detailed advice for how to run individual scenarios more effectively as a GM, as well as advice on more general topics that apply to multiple different scenarios.

{% include warning.html content="This website contains spoilers for many different organized play scenarios. All of these articles are written to help a GM prep for a certain scenario, which means that they spoil plot points, monsters, and other encounters with no warning. If you do not wish to be spoiled for a certain scenario, then do not open that scenario's page!" %}
