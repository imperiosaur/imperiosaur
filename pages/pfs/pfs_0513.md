## Context

This scenario was released in the middle of Season 5. Season 5, in addition to being a season attached to an adventure path, also introduced the idea of faction-specific scenarios. This season was the first time that they got rid of the individual faction handouts in each scenario and instead made the PCs figure out what the mission is based off the faction's goals. This scenario tends to be much easier to figure out than others that have come out in the same season.

## GMing Advice

### A2. The Acts of Iomedae

First, [here is a picture of what the door looks like](http://pfsprep.com/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?250).

In order to solve the puzzle, there are three "Ahas" that the PCs need to make. They need to (1) realize that the puzzles refers to the Acts of Iomedae, (2) assign the correct Acts to the correct statements, and (3) figure out how to input the Act numbers into the door correctly.

For (1), this Aha needs to come fairly quickly. Frequently, the players will ask if these sound like anything they've heard before which is a wonderful time to ask for the Knowledge(history/religion) check. If they spend too long on this step, feel free to call for this check yourself. If a character worships Iomedae, they should get a bonus to remember these, and if a character has a holy text of Iomedae on them, then they should get all 12 for free.

For (2), 

* A **broken sword**(\#6) is reborn in **knight-saving blood**(\#9) so that **Absalom**(\#7) might withstand evil.
* **Inspired by her courage**(\#4) by fight of the righteous, the **Black Prince was judged in the Halls of Aroden**(\#8).
* By **escaping the wound**(\#1), her royal servants helped her slay the **King of the Barrowood**(\#3), **ascending her to godhood**(\#11).
* Because of **The Battle of Three Sorrows**(\#5), the cities of **Eleder**(\#2) and **Kantaria**(\#10) prospered with freedom and wealth.

## Known Issues

* The answer to the puzzle is wrong. It is listed in the scenario as "6–7–9–Blank, 4–8–Blank–Blank, 1–3–1–1, and 2–5–1–0", but the answer should actually be "6–9–7–Blank, 4–8–Blank–Blank, 1–3–1–1, and 5–2–1–0".
* The DC for the Diplomacy check in A3 is supposed to be lower in the higher tier. The DC is based off of the celestial legionnaires' Charisma score, and their Charisma score is lower in the higher tier than the lower tier. According to John Compton, [this is okay](http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2qmss?513-Weapon-in-the-Rift-GM-Discussion-Spoilers#8).
