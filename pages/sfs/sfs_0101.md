## Context

This scenario was one of the Gencon 2017 scenarios, and therefore was one of the first adventures ever written for Starfinder as a system. When it was first run, the vast majority of players playing it had never played any Starfinder before. In addition to the information in the threads linked above, there is also good information in the [First Wave Clarifications and Errata thread](http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2uipu&page=3?Starfinder-Society-Scenarios-First-Wave).

## GMing Advice

This is a nice, light intro to Starfinder Society. As long as you have a plan for how to deal with the junkracer scene, everything else should go smoothly.

### Mission 1: Acquisitives

This is the big encounter of the scenario. It's not that it's particularly tough, but it tends to go long and can quickly become boring or frustrating if you don't have a good plan as a GM going into it.

The first thing you want is a handout that explains the basic rules of the race to hand to the players. The concept of the race is simple enough, but when you're throwing people into a subsystem like that, it's much easier to have a visual reference to give them. Also, when you're explaining the rules for how to upgrade your junkracer, also explain the rules for how the race works. This will give the PCs the ability to make informed choices based on how the race actually works. There's no worse feeling than having a really good strategy, only to find out that the rules that you didn't know completely invalidate everything you did.

{% include plug.html content="A one-page handout that explains all the rules for the race for the players is available as part of [my prep document on PFSPrep](http://pfsprep.com/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?2626)." %}

The next thing you want is a way to represent the NPCs during the Preparation Phase. You can use the minis that you're planning on using for the race section, but even better are the portraits that Eleanor Ferron made up for her NPCs. Damanta took them and [put them four to a page on PFSPrep](http://pfsprep.com/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?2501), and printing them out and having them on the map will help your PCs remember who they're racing against.

The next thing you want is a method for generating the NPC racer stats in front of you. You are controlling five racers to the PCs one, and even though Laboni's racer will end up being more complicated than anyone else's racer, you can easily spend two times the amount of time that the PCs spend on their junkracer every round. You can mitigate some of this by being dramatic with your die rolls, but the more organized you are, the better you're going to be. Cutting out the handouts in the back of the scenario will be certainly be helpful, but even better would be to assign the NPCs to racers before the scenario begins and write out the final stats ahead of time. Obviously this may need to be adjusted based off of the PCs' sabotage, but other than that it will save you from calculating the same thing over and over again. In particular, the most important things to calculate are the Piloting modifiers and the attack modifiers from the pilot and the racer.

The last thing you want is a method for representing the race on a map. There are a couple different race tracks that people have made that are available on the discussion thread, but you don't need anything that complicated. The simplest way to run it is to grab a standard Paizo Flip-Mat. The standard size is 30x24 squares, which means that you can use the long side, treat each square as 100 feet, and the race is on the length of the flip mat. If a junkracer needs to be on a 50ft. marker (like 750ft.), put them on the line between the squares.

{% include warning.html content="Make sure if you use this method for keeping track of the racers that you don't use the Starfinder Basic Terrain Flip-Mat. Due to a production error, the squares are too big and it's not actually 30x24!" %}

### Mission 2: Dataphiles

This mission is fairly straightforward. First the PCs need to fake a death, then they need to fight a couple corporate gangers to succeed at making sure Ceren can escape.

For the skill challenge section of this mission, give them the two goals of getting a death certificate and getting a new identity, then listen to what they have to say about completing the challenges. The write-ups for each of the steps in the scenario are fairly good, but don't be afraid to improvise if the PCs want to try something that's not written. Good guidelines for this section is that an average check should be about DC 15, whereas if the PCs want to try something particularly hard or risky, then a DC of 17 or 18 may be more appropriate. If the PCs just seem to be flailing, the summarize the possible things that they can do for them, but give them a chance to come up with stuff first.

The combat in this mission isn't that hard. You'll knock a Resolve Point out of a couple characters to recover their Stamina, but otherwise this isn't too dangerous unless a crit happens or the PCs have really bad dice.

### Mission 3: Exo-Guardians

This mission is the introduction to Strawberry Machine Cake. It's hard to be a member of the Starfinder Society community online without seeing a reference or two to Strawberry Machine Cake. All of the SMC fan base was based off this one little side mission from this scenario. Part of it is the pure hilarity of being sent to get a "sugar pop" album in the middle of everything else you have to do and part of it is who is assigning your to get the album in the first place. Zigvigix is a funny little character, and the joy that comes through when telling the PCs to incinerate the creature or to buy an album is really funny. Lastly, it's a nice reminder that this isn't Pathfinder anymore. It's one of those little side missions that doesn't really have a good analog in fantasy games.

The side mission shouldn't take that long to run in game, so feel free to get a little descriptive, especially for characters who wouldn't be caught dead in line for a sugar pop album. The GM Discussion thread has lots of examples for what people have used as to represent "sugar pop" out of game, and if you play in a space that where music is a good idea, then find your favorite upbeat song and enjoy!

Every intro scenario has to have a rough combat, and this scenario is no exception! The Feather Stalker is a ferocious beast, and has a good chance of dropping a level 1 character by the time the combat is over. Fortunately with the Starfinder stabilizing rules and the fact that there is only one other combat in the scenario, it is unlikely that you will actually kill someone. The only way you'll kill someone is if they keep trying to use the "Stay in the Fight" ability and run themselves out of resolve points. Do become familiar with how death/dying/stabilizing works in Starfinder before running this though.

### Mission 4: Wayfinders

This mission has a map in the scenario. You don't need it. This encounter is all about interacting with the two kids and the alien, and doesn't really need a tactical map. If you're playing online, you may need to have the map in order to display something on the screen while the encounter happens, but if you're playing face-to-face, then theater of the mind is going to be the way to go.

Rolling to figure out what the alien encounter should look like is better done at the beginning of the scenario. You're already going to be improvising what the alien's response is to the PCs' actions, which means it's better if you have a solid understanding on what the alien is like before the session even starts. Once you have what the results are from the table, write those down on a separate sheet of paper so you can reference them without the extraneous information from the tables. The most important thing is quickly knowing which skills are relevant to the encounter or quickly being able to find them.

## Known Issues

* The map of the warehouse is missing the tags to say where each of the starting points are. A should be in the middle of the map where the destroyed stuff is, B should be in the pit at the top of the map, C is on top of the scaffolding in the upper left, and D is on the walkway in the bottom left.
* Characters only get the Star Sugar Heartlove!!! boon if they spend the 50 credits on the album during the scenario. [If a GM wants this boon, they need to spend 50 credits as well](http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2uipu&page=2?Starfinder-Society-Scenarios-First-Wave#75).
* The chronicle sheet should give [753 credits, not 509 credits](http://paizo.com/threads/rzs2uipu&page=4?Starfinder-Society-Scenarios-First-Wave#178).
