## GMing Advice

### Timing

As this is dinner party scenario, the biggest issue that you're going to run into is timing. Dinner party encounters will take as much time as you let it, so it's good to go into the slot with an understanding of how long you have. Consider that it's going to take about 30 minutes for the intro and about 30 minutes for the conclusion/paperwork, and that the dinner party is going to take up about 1.5 to 2 times the amount of time that it will take to run the other encounters. If you have a four hour slot, then you're probably looking at spending about 75 minutes on the dinner party and about 50 minutes on each of the other encounters. Adjust as needed for your specific time frame.

(Understanding the timing of your scenario and budgeting time ahead of the slot is always a good idea, but it's really important for this scenario because of the time management issues that dinner party scenarios always present.)

### High Society Gala

And here we have the dinner party encounter. Much like every other dinner party before it, the rules are slightly different for this encounter. Below is an overview of the rules for this version of the influence rules:
* Each PC can interact with one NPC per social round.
* When that PC's turn comes up, they can either make small talk, attempt to influence that NPC, or aid another PC's efforts this round.
  * *Small Talk* - The PC can attempt a DC 10 Sense Motive check to find out what skills the PCs can use to influence that NPC. A successful check gets one skill plus one more skill for every 5 that they beat the DC by.
  * *Influence* - The PC can attempt a skill check to influence that NPC. They don't need to have identified that the skill will work with Small Talk, but if they pick a skill that's not listed, then it won't work (unless you're feeling really nice). The PC takes a -2 penalty on the check for each time that skill has been used with that NPC this encounter, whether or not those influence attempts were successful or not. The DC is 17 at 1-2 and 20 at 3-4. There is no advantage to beating the DC by 5 or more.
  * *Aid Another* - The PC can attempt to aid either a small talk attempt or an influence attempt, but it must be done with the same skill that the small talk or influence attempt is being done with.
